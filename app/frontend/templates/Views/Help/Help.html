        <h2>For Hardworkers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Congratulations! You’ve taken the first step towards getting a job that actually means something to you.
            Intrn.co is the perfect way to hone your skills and make a real impact at a startup that values you.
            <br><br>
            Applying for a job is simple too. Browse postings on the homepage and use the filters to narrow what you’re
            looking for. Start with the closest role that matches your skillset, then narrow it down from there.
            Download a job posting’s challenge and see if it’s something you think you could tackle. Don’t get
            discouraged if a challenge may be beyond your current abilities… challenges are a great opportunity to try a
            new piece of software or try something new. The challenges you complete for job applications go further than
            a potential interview, as you can use them as case studies for a personal or portfolio website in future
            interviews.
            <br><br>
            Before you apply, be sure to have your challenge and resume ready-to-go. Fill out the job application with
            as much info as you can, but don’t worry too much about putting-in your social links. They help, but aren’t
            mandatory. Upload your challenge and resume, and leave a quick note to the startup. It doesn’t need to be a
            full-blown cover letter, but try to make a good impression.</p>

        <h2>For Potential Employers</h2>

        <p>Welcome to a better way to hire. Login at the upper navigation bar with your Google account to start posting
            positions for hire. You’ll be taken to a page where you create a company or organization that you’d like to
            hire for. Enter the name, and posting passcode to access your hiring dashboard. To post your first job,
            click on the “Post a Job” button. While filling out a job application, be sure to compose every field
            completely and correctly, but know that if you make any errors, you can fix them after posting the job. If
            you don’t fill every field and upload a challenge document, you won’t be able to post a job.
            <br><br>
            Each job posting requires a challenge, which is really your way to access an applicant’s technical ability.
            Challenges should be straightforward, and short enough so that an applicant can complete them in a full day.
            If you’re having trouble putting-together a challenge, have a look at some of our sample challenges for
            inspiration. Borrow some of our pre-made templates to draft a challenge in minutes.
            <br><br>
            Keep in mind that challenges should be the first thing you consider when looking at an application, so
            double-check to make sure they’re clear and succinct, and that they’ll give you the best idea of whether a
            candidate can learn their way in your role.
            <br><br>
            Once you start getting candidates, you can browse they’re applications and download their challenges
            directly from the job posting in your hiring dashboard. Select a job to get stats on how popular your
            posting is. </p>
