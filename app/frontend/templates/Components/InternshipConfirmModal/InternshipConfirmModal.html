    <p>You can only classify someone as an intern if each of the below criteria is
        met. If any one or more of the below criteria cannot be met, then the law requires that you treat
        the person as an employee and pay him/her minimum wage and overtime as you would for any other
        non-exempt employee. Below are the criteria that must be met for the intern designation:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-position: inside">
        <li>The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the company’s business, is similar
            to training that would be given in a vocational school;
        </li>
        <li>The internship is for the benefit of the intern;</li>
        <li>The intern does not displace regular employees and works under close observation;</li>
        <li>The company derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern and on occasion the
            company’s operations may actually be impeded;
        </li>
        <li>The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the internship; and</li>
        <li>The company and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time
            spent in the internship.
        </li>
    </ol>
